Welcome to <strong>AIS2 (Artificial Intelligence and Systems Security) Lab</strong>! AIS2Lab is an AI-oriented security research team established by [Asst Prof. Daoyuan Wu](https://daoyuan14.github.io/) in the [Division of Industrial Data Science](https://www.ln.edu.hk/sds/dids), [School of Data Science](https://www.ln.edu.hk/sds) at [Lingnan University (LU)](https://www.ln.edu.hk/), one of the eight [UGC-funded universities](https://www.ugc.edu.hk/eng/ugc/site/fund_inst.html) in Hong Kong.

We adopt <u>a systems security mindset</u> to advance the security and trustworthiness of artificial intelligence in the era of Large Language Models (LLMs). At AIS2Lab, we are committed to conducting <u>inter-disciplinary research</u> that integrates knowledge and methodologies from computer science, artificial intelligence, law, healthcare, and other related fields. Our work aims to address emerging security challenges and promote responsible innovation across both technical and societal domains.

Specifically, our research focuses on the following key areas:

<strong>Large Language Model and AI Security:</strong> [LLMs for Cybersecurity](/llm4sec/); Security of LLMs; AI Safety; LLM + Law.

<strong>Blockchain and Smart Contract Security:</strong> Chain & DeFi Security; Consensus Security; Transaction Compliance.

<strong>GPU Software and Medical System Security:</strong> AI Infrastructure Security; Healthcare and Medical System Security.

<strong>Novel Program Analysis and Mobile Security:</strong> Novel Program Analysis & Fuzzing; LLM for Mobile; EdgeAI Security.

Through close collaboration with experts from diverse disciplines, AIS2Lab aims to build secure and responsible AI systems that benefit both technology and society.
To realize this vision, we are always seeking passionate and persistent students (PhD/RA/Postdoc/Interns) with backgrounds or strong interests in AI/LLMs, blockchain, GPU and medical software, programming languages, and fuzzing to join AIS2Lab. We value [persistence](https://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~cslui/potential_students.html) and a commitment to research excellence.
<br>
Currently, we have the following priority openings:

<div style="background-color: #f3f4f6; border-left: 4px solid #6c63ff; padding: 1em 1.5em; margin: 1.5em 0; border-radius: 8px;">
We are hiring <strong>one Postdoc</strong> or <strong>two RAs</strong> who (aspire to) understand <b>GPU software security</b> or <b>medical system security</b>.
Additionally, there is <strong>one extra fully-funded PhD opening</strong> (on top of the current hirings: one PhD student funded by LU PhD Student Fund, plus one self-financed PhD).
If you are passionate about AI, security, or interdisciplinary research and interested in these positions, feel free to <a href="mailto:daoyuanwu@ln.edu.hk">email us</a> with your CV!
More details are available on <a href="https://daoyuan14.github.io/" target="_blank">Prof. Wu's homepage</a>.
<br>
Self-financed PhD/MPhil positions are used <strong>only</strong> in cases where applicants do not meet the scholarship requirements set by the university committee but are still academically qualified to pursue PhD/MPhil studies. In such cases, I will support you as a part-time RA, which can fully cover your tuition fees, with an additional allowance of 36K HKD per year.
